# Audapter C++ MEX Code
Audapter: Real-time speech signal perturbation (formant frequencies, pitch, timing and intensity). This is the MEX core of the MATLAB package. Clone this whole repository if you want to make programmatic changes to the Audapter program itself.

If you just want to run Audapter, the compiled .mex file is the only thing from this respository that you need. Download it from the ["Releases" section of the GitHub page](https://github.com/blab-lab/audapter_mex/releases), and put it somewhere on your Matlab path. See below for additional setup to run the blab-lab fork of Audapter.

## Setup to use Audapter
1. Download the compiled .mex file from the ["Releases" section of this repo](https://github.com/blab-lab/audapter_mex/releases), and add it to your MATLAB path. Call `Audapter('version')` from the Command Window and verify that it shows the version listed on the Releases section of this repo. 
2. Download the [blab-lab/audapter_matlab](https://github.com/blab-lab/audapter_matlab) repository and the [blab-lab/commonmcode repository](https://github.com/blab-lab/commonmcode) and add them to your MATLAB path. You must use the blab-lab fork of these repositories if you are using the .mex file from this blab-lab/audapter_mex repository.

### Optional but recommended setup
1. In your MATLAB path, move the commonmcode folder to the bottom. This will preserve the MATLAB default spectrogram color settings
2. If you are using a Focusrite device for recording, such as a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, Generation 4 devices are not supported. Generation 1, 2, and 3 devices are supported. Additionally, you must use the Focusrite driver version 4.65.5. This driver works on all Windows operating system versions. Newer Focusrite drivers cause MATLAB to crash when Audapter tries to take control of the device, (ie, when it `'Start'`s). Download drivers from [Focusrite's website](https://downloads.focusrite.com/focusrite).
3. The Audapter built-in demos (such as `audapterDemo_online.m`) assume you are using a Focusrite device. If you are using a different device, you will need to edit the command `Audapter('deviceName', ...)`. For MOTU devices, the device name will be 'MOTU MicroBook'. 

### Troubleshooting
1. **Operating system**.  Audapter does not work on Mac. It is confirmed to work on Windows 10 and 11, and should work on 8 and 7.
2. Make sure you only have one version of files on your MATLAB path. Enter `which [function-name] -all` in the MATLAB Command Window to verify which files are on your path.
3. The Audapter built-in demos assume your Current Folder is the audapter_matlab/example_data folder.
4. Here is a simple script to test if Audapter can start properly:
```
Audapter('deviceName', 'Focusrite USB');
p = getAudapterDefaultParams('male');
AudapterIO('init', p)
Audapter('start')
Audapter('stop')You don't need to change
```
